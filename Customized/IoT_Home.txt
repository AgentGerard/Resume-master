Hello,
    I do not meet your stated education requirement but would like to present myself for any supporting positions that may arise. In addition to 15 years of experience releasing cutting edge products for Apple and Google, I spend my personal time working in A/V for theater productions in San Francisco. This includes Lighting, Sound and Interactive Media using MAX/MSP, Quartz Composer, and made to order event software. I also have 25 years experience with MIDI and Digital audio, as well as significant exploration of interfacing with the new breed of personal home security systems (Simplisafe).

     Thank you for your consideration,
Michael Gerard
